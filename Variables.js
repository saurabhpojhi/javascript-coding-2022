// 4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:
// Using var
// Using let
// Using const

//In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:

var x= 4;
var y =5;
var z= x+y;
console.log(z);

// When to Use JavaScript var?
// Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, orconst.

// The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

// The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

// If you want your code to run in older browser, you must use var.

// When to Use JavaScript const?
// If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.

// If you think the value of the variable can change, use let.


const pen =10;
const book=20;
let total = pen+book;

console.log(total);

// The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).

// Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.

// Variables defined with let must be Declared before use.

// Variables defined with let have Block Scope.

//let x = "ram";
//let x=0;         // SyntaxError: 'x' has already been declared


//Note that variables may hold values that have different data types:

// String ex
  let myVariable ="Ram";
  console.log(myVariable);
  //Number 
  let Number =10;
  console.log(Number);
// Boolean
let Boolean = true;
console.log(Boolean);
//Array
 let arraytype = [1,'ram','shyam',10];
 console.log(arraytype);

 //Object
 let object ='h1'
 console.log(object);
